                <p>Astronomy is the study of celestial objects such as planets, the moons, galaxies and stars.
                     Astronomy comes from the Greek word, Astronomos which means star-arranging. Astronomy also deals with outer space, 
                     universe and the motion of the celestial objects. </p>

                <p>The theory of relativity is the study of motion of particle in which relative to the observer in different reference frame. 
                    Relativity is categorized into two, special theory of relativity and general theory of relativity, both developed by Albert Einstein from 1905 to 1907 . </p>

                <p>Quantum mechanics is the study of subatomic particles in which the states of the particle described by wavefunction, psi is a superpositon of various possible
                    outcomes. The wavefunction itself has no physical meaning but the absolute square is, which tells you the probability at the particular measured state of the
                    particle.  </p>
